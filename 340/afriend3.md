The fire department of Springdale, Ohio has requested that I make an app for the purpose of looking up the location of electric car batteries and important hardware components to avoid and be aware of. Cars from different brands, and even different models from the same brand, lack standardization in placement and visual clues, leading firefighters needing to look up car manuals and navigate to pages listing the necessary information by hand. As one may imagine, this takes valuable time. They would like this app to function on the Microsoft tablets built into the trucks, and on the phones of their members, and want to have offline capability so it can be used while in motion.


The app should include: 
* A library of car models with components and necessary information
* A search function, by brand/model/(year if relevant)
* A dropdown style menu for navigating individual brands by pictures of the cars along with names
* A UI that works on many devices
* Offline capabilities
* As little lag as possible

The frontend would most likely be made with scripting languages, though a rudimentary java app would suffice. The back end would most likely be developed in C++ for a combination of performance and group knowledge. The information hosted within the app would need to be drawn from the manufacturersâ€™ websites, likely by hand, unless a scraper can be created in a reasonable amount of time. 


The end goal of this product would be to offer this as an open platform for fire stations to use as they pleased, simplifying the process of finding the needed information, thus lowering response and reaction times and allowing them to do their jobs more efficiently.
