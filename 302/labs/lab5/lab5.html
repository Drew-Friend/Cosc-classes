<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 5 (150 pts: Fall 2022)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
Social network graphs can be used to suggest
people you might want to connect with. In this lab, you will write
a simple program for doing that. The point of the exercise
is for you to learn how to create and manipulate a graph.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>

Your TAs will tell you how to submit your work to Canvas.
Do not email your code to the instructor or the TAs as they cannot
upload the code to Canvas for you.
<p>

The files Friendnet1.cpp, Friendnet2.cpp, and Friendnet3.cpp
are due 11:59pm Thursday Oct 20, 2022.
The submitted code must compile and execute without
seg faulting to be graded.
<p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

Download lab5.tar from Canvas.
This file gives you
Hydra executables 
sfriendnet1, sfriendnet2, and sfriendnet3,
data file names.txt, skeleton program
Friendnet.cpp, and a makefile. 
Your job is to write the Friendnet programs and make them behave 
as described next.
<p>

<UL>

<LI>
<b>Program basics</b>: The three programs all behave in 
the same way. They differ only with respect to their
implementation of the underlying graph. Their 
mode of operation is as follows.
<p>

Read an unspecified number of names from stdin. Make
the names the vertices of a graph. Storage and
data manipulation is handled by a class called vlabels
(short for vertex labels).
Use s function called set_oldfriends() to establish
who are friends.
These connections become the edges of the graph.
Storage and data manipulation is handled by a class
called adjtable (short for adjacency table).
Next,
use a function called set_newfriends() to determine
who might become new friends. 
These are friends-of-friends who are not currently
friends. In graph terms, you look for vertices
that are two edges away. Friends and possible new
friends are reported to stdout as shown below.
<p>

The main function parses command-line
arguments and terminates with a usage statement unless
the program is called correctly:
<p>

<pre>
unix> cat datafile.txt | ./Friendnet [-seed=N] [-M0=N] [-M1=N]
</pre>
As usual, square brackets indicate an optional argument.
Make no assumptions about their order. 
The arguments are either present or not somewhere on the
command-line. More about them below.
<p>

Proceed by deriving Friendnet1.cpp from the Friendnet.cpp 
skeleton program given to you.
Then derive Friendnet2.cpp from Friendnet1.cpp followed
by Friendnet3.cpp from Friendnet2.cpp. The modifications
needed for the latter two versions are all with respect to
the two set_xxxfriends() functions.

<LI>
<b>Friendnet1.cpp</b>: Unlike for past assignments where
the code was built up incrementally, this description will
outline how each componenent should work when all is said
and done.
You may find it convenient to go back
and forth between the vtable and adjtable classes, 
the three functions that use them and the main function
as opposed to writing any of them in their entirety.
That said, you can develop and test set_oldfriends()
before you work on set_newfriends().
<p>

Class vtable encapsulates a private 1D array of vertex 
labels implemented as a vector of strings.
Public member functions include size() which returns
the number of elements in the array, push() which adds a
new vertex label to the array, operator[] which returns
a vertex label, as well as begin() and end() which
return iterators that provide pointer-like
access to the data in the 1D array.
Some of these functions take arguments. Some don't.
Some return data. Some don't. Figure that out on your
own. Pass data by reference when that avoids
unnecessary copying of data. Many of the functions can
be implemented as vector wrapper functions.
<p>

Class adjtable encapsulates a dense 2D array of edges.
This could be implemented as a vector of vectors
of integers, but you are free to use your own array
implementation if you prefer.
Public member functions include size() which returns
the number of rows of the 2D array, set_size() which
allocates and initializes the 2D array given a number
of rows, and operator[] which returns a reference 
to a row of the 2D array. Like above, figure unspecified
function arguments and return data types out on your own,
and pass data by reference when that avoids
unnecessary copying of data. 
<p>

The main function looks for and parses
the optional command-line arguments mentioned above,
then seeds the standard random number generator
before reading names from stdin and adding them
to a vtable called names. Use function vtable::push() 
to do this. Sort the vtable content 
(requires vtable::begin() and
vtable::end() to be defined).
The next step is to use function set_oldfriends()
to populate an adjtable called friends that defines who 
are friends followed by function set_newfriends()
to populate an adjtable called new_friends that defines who 
might be possible new friends.
Function writetofile() is used write the friends data to
a file called doknow1.txt and the new_friends data to
a file called mightknow1.txt.
<p>

Function set_oldfriends() should work as follows.
The adjtable friends is set to be an NxN array where
N is the number of names considered.
A random number of friendships M is generated for each name,
namely, M0 &le; M &le; M1, where M0=1 and M1=2 by default
but can be changed thru same named command-line arguments.
You must ensure that 0 &lt; M0 &le; M1 &lt; 6 when accepting
user defined values.
The friendnet must produce a symmetric graph meaning if there
is an edge between vertices i and j, then
there should also be an edge between vertices j and i. 
As a result,
each vertex may end up being connected to more vertices than
the ones defined above. That's OK.
<p>

Hint: Create an index list do_know[] = {0, 1, ..., N-1}.
When creating friends for the ith name on the list,
randomize the do_know list M times while ensuring that
index i isn't among the M entries at the front of the list.
This produces the desired random friend indices.
Update the friends adjtable accordingly, e.g.,
for k=0:M-1, j=do_know[k], friends[i][j]=1, friends[j][i]=1.
You do not need to reset the do_know[] list between uses.
<p>

Function set_newfriends() should work as follows.
The adjtable new_friends is set to be an NxN array where
N is the number of names considered. 
For each name, use nested loops to iterate over 
friends-of-friends. Update new_friends to include potential
new friends while making sure not to make someone
a possible friend of themselves or to add some who is 
already a friend. That is, new_friends[i][k] should only
be 1 if friends[i][j] is 1, friends[j][k] is 1, 
k is not equal to i and friend[i][k] is 0.
This sounds more complicated than it is. Draw it out
to see if visually.
<p>

Function writetofile() produces
nicely formatted friends and new_friends output to the above 
mentioned files depending which adjtable is given to it. 
Determine the length of the longest name. 
Use that to set the field width for each name written. 
Only write eight names per line. See 
output examples below. 
When in doubt, run the solution executable
and check its output.

<LI> 
<b>Friendnet2.cpp</b>: Replace the dense 2D-array used
by adjtable in Friendnet1.cpp with a sparse 2D-array. Modify 
functions as necessary. You may for example want to replace 
many of the index for-loops with iterator loops. Hint: 
The presence of an (i,j) entry indicates
that an edge exists between those vertices. Hint: You may 
need to use the std::sort and std::unique algorithms to 
ensure order and uniqueness of the edges produced. See 
the class12_graph1_handout.pdf code.
The program behavior and output is identical to that of Friendnet1.
<p>

<LI> 
<b>Friendnet3.cpp</b>: Replace the sparse 2D-array used
by adjtable in Friendnet2.cpp with an ordered set
(binary search tree) in the form of an std::set. 
Modify functions as necessary. 
Hint: This is mostly a matter of 
replacing vector with set definitions although a few other
changes are needed. Hint: The std::set supports finding keys.
Hint: As mentioned above, the std::set produces a binary 
search tree holding unique keys -- some of
the extra work needed for the sparse 2D-array can 
thus be removed.
The program
behavior and output is again identical to that of Friendnet1.
<p>

<LI>
To summarize, the three Friendnet programs use
different implementations for the graph that represents the 
social network modeled:
Friendnet1 uses a dense adjacency matrix in the form
of a vector of vectors
where all vectors have the same length; 
Friendnet2 uses a sparse adjacency matrix in the form of
of a vector of variable vectors (lists);
and
Friendnet3 uses a sparse adjacency matrix in the form of
of a vector of sets.
They all achieve the same goal but do so differently.

<h3>Example friendnet1 output</h3>
<pre>
unix> cat names.txt | ./Friendnet1 -M0=1 -M1=1 -seed=302

unix> head doknow1.txt
ABE        : MILLICENT 
ABEL       : REINALDO   ROSARIO    SLOAN     
ABRAHAM    : LANCASTER  STOUT

ADAMS      : MCDONALD  
ADDIE      : FLEMING    GABRIELA   LANCASTER

ADKINS     : LENORA    
AGNES      : ARTHUR     BOWMAN     MARCUS     NOEMI      REEVES     SIDNEY    
AHMED      : QUINN     

unix head mightknow1.txt
ABE        : AUBREY     DAREN      GARRY      HARPER     MAC        WEBER     
ABEL       : BLACKWELL  DWIGHT     LYDIA     
ABRAHAM    : ADDIE     
ADAM       : LEVINE    
ADAMS      : HARRELL    HENDRIX    SEARS     
ADDIE      : ABRAHAM    MACDONALD 
ADELINE    : ANASTASIA  HECTOR     HOFFMAN   
ADKINS     : STEVENSON 
AGNES      : BARRERA    BARTLETT   BEACH      FOSTER     NANCY      QUINCY     REYNA      SOSA      
AHMED      : MERLIN    

unix> grep "^REINALDO " doknow1.txt
REINALDO   : ABEL       LYDIA     

unix> grep "^ROSARIO " doknow1.txt
ROSARIO    : ABEL      

unix> grep "^SLOAN " mightknow1.txt
SLOAN      : ABEL       BLACKWELL  DWIGHT    
</pre>

So Abel is friends with Reinaldo, Rosario and Sloan. Since Rosario only knows Abel, 
she doesn't add potential new friends. But Reinaldo also knows Lydia who
therefore becomes a potential new friend for Adam.
Likewise, Sloan also knows Blackwell and Dwigth who also 
become potential new friends for Adam.
Same for all the other entries.
Warning: This quickly gets complicated to keep track of but it all comes down to
determining who are two edges away in a graph the represents the relationships.
<p>

Hint: The "^NAME " syntax used for grep means that NAME must be found at the
beginning of the line and have a space following it. Try "NAME" and see what
happens.

The Friendnet2 and Friendnet3 programs produce output identical to the above.
